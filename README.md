## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing historical mutual fund prices and related metrics such as:

- Opening price
- Closing price
- Net Asset Value (NAV)
- Volume
- Market indices (e.g., S&P 500, NIFTY 50)

> **Note:** Sample data is included in the `data/` directory. For production, integrate an API like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance for live data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`/`keras`
- **APIs**:
  - Alpha Vantage for financial data retrieval (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Interactive environment for data preprocessing and model training
